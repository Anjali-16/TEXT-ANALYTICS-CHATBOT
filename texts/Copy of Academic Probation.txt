Academic Probation
It is important that you remain in good academic standing (https://catalog.usf.edu/content.php?catoid=18&navoid=2820#in-good-standingLinks to an external site.).  Essentially, this means that you need to maintain an overall GPA of at least 3.0.

If your GPA drops below 3.0, you are placed on academic probation at the end of the semester in which your GPA fell below 3.0.  It is important that you address the situation as soon as the next semester.  If you do not, there is a chance that you will be dismissed from the program.  You also will not be able to complete an internship.  The process for academic probation is described at

In order to help you get off academic probation, the School has decided to restrict you to three courses in the semester after you were placed on academic probation.
