Off-Campus Housing
This off-campus website lists rental units and is a service provided by USF Student
               Government in contractual agreement with Off-Campus Partners, Inc. While this list
               does not constitute endorsement of any rental properties, we hope that this service
               helps students, faculty, and staff find safe and comfortable living arrangements while
               attending USF.
