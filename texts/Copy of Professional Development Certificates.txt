Professional Development Certificates
To help our students in their efforts to acquire professionally marketable knowledge and skills, the department has developed a certification exam support program that refunds the costs of relevant certification exams for students in the department's degree programs. This fund is made possible by the generous support of our local industry partners. Exam support is on a first-come-first-serve basis while funds last.  The fund is managed by Anna Bahvala.
